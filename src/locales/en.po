The projects given by the school challenged us to solve problems that required self-initiated research with other students and on the Internet. The projects are then corrected by students and by an automatic program. The corrections are very strict: no unexpected behavior, no errors, no crashes, no leaks, and have to be normed. Any errors will lead to a zero."
