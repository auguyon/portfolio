There are no teachers or classes, only projects to be solved alone and/or in small groups in a peer-to-peer learning environment. The projects given by the school challenged us to solve problems that required self-initiated research with other students and on the Internet. The projects are then corrected by students and by an automatic program. The corrections are very strict: no unexpected behavior, no errors, no crashes, no leaks, and have to be normed. Any errors will lead to a zero.","desc resume 3":"Creation of a Python software for the treatment of tension contained in many files for the CNRS laboratory.","desc resume 4":"Spearheaded a mobile app with React-Native and AWS serverless structure, and was the sole person responsible for its stack and development then created two showcase websites, uploaded with AWS Amplify.","desc resume 5":"Developing a mobile application with React-Native.
